Building cgminer using Docker
-----------------------------

This document describes how to compile cgminer-asic inside a Docker container.

1. Install Docker on your system.
2. From the repository root build the Docker image:

        docker build -t cgminer-asic .

   This produces an image with all required build dependencies and a compiled
   copy of cgminer.
3. Run a container from the image:

        docker run --rm -it cgminer-asic

   The source tree is located under /workspace inside the container and
   cgminer is compiled during the image build. If you want to rebuild the
   binary, run the following commands inside the container:

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --enable-bitaxe
        make -j"$(nproc)"
